We have two jenkinsfile for quick deployment of website changes:

 - "Jenkinsfile-build" - this file is needed to create a docker container in case changes occur in the site repository;
  - "Jenkinsfile-deploy" - this file is needed to deploy the current version of the site from the repository with the source files.
